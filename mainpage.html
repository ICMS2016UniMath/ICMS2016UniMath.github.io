<h3>Aim and Scope</h3>

The goal of the session is to bring together people in the proof assistant community working on the ideas inspired by the current activity surrounding the Univalence Axiom and, more generally, univalent foundations of mathematics and homotopy type theory. We expect to have representatives from several existent proof assistants as well as people working on the development of new type theories that will or may become the basis of proof assistants in the future. We consider the problem of developing the infrastructure that will allow formal specification and eventually verification of new proof assistants to be an important and possibly the most important one that is facing the community as the complexity of the type theories underlying the proof assistants grows and hope to also have talks from people and teams working in this direction.

  <li><h3>Exploiting uniformity in substitution: the Nuprl term model</h3>
    <b>Abishek Anand</b> (Cornell)

  <strong>Abstract</strong>:
  Formalizing syntax and substitution is often the first step towards a formally verified proof assistant. Many non-trivial properties about substitution are typically required.
For a language with many term constructors, e.g. Nuprl, proofs about substitution typically need similar reasoning across many cases.
Therefore, while formalizing Nuprl, we used Howe's uniform representation of terms, which allowed us to consider only 3 cases while defining concepts like substitution and free variables, and proving properties about them. Extending the language with new constructs required absolutely no change in our thousands of lines of proofs about substitution, free variables, and alpha equality. 
Inspired by this robustness, we have created a library by generalizing our proofs to work for a  large class of languages. One can specify a language as a collection of term constructors and their variable-binding signatures, and use our rich collection of proofs. We have recently used this library for proofs about the Certicoq compiler for Coq.

  <li><h3>A model of Cubical Type Theory in Nuprl</h3>
    <b>Mark Bickford</b> (Cornell University)
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
    <strong>Abstract</strong>: 
One type theory may serve as a meta theory for another and we
build a model of the target type theory in its meta theory.
This gives us a relative consistency theorem. Moreover, when we use
only constructive methods in the meta theory we obtain a constructive
interpretation of the target type theory.

We are carrying out such a project to get a constructive model
of the Cubical Type Theory of Coquand et.al. which satisfies the
Univalence Axiom. The model is a constructive presheaf model over
a base category in which the objects are finite sets of names, I, J,
and an arrow, I -> J is function from J to dM(I), the free DeMorgan algebra generated by I. 
To make this construction or, in general any presheaf model, it seems that we must reason extensionally as in set theory. This is difficult in an intensional type theory like Coq, but Nuprl's extensional constructive
type theory gives us the flexibility we need.

Since we have built a model of Nuprl in Coq, the constructive
interpretation of Cubical Type Theory with Univalence is therefore
built in two steps. First build Nuprl in Coq to get a good extensional
theory, and then use that theory to get a univalent theory.

Univalence follows from the existence of <i>uniform composition structure</i> for all types in the new theory, including a special Glue type. We have proved the equivalence of two different definitions of composition structure, and shown that they exist for
the Pi, Sigma, and Path types. By the time of this meeting, we expect that composition for Glue, composition for
Universe, and Univalence will all be verified.

  <li><h3>The HoTT/HoTT Library in Coq: Designing for Speed</h3>
    <b>Jason Gross</b> (MIT)
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
    <strong>Abstract</strong>: 

  The HoTT/HoTT library is one of the major Coq libraries exploring univalent foundations and homotopy type theory, the other being UniMath.  The library includes formalization of the basic type formers, some axiomatic higher inductive types including the circle, the interval, suspensions, and quotients, a formalization of modalities (reflective subtoposes) using modules as a way to quantify over all universe levels, formalizations of Cantor spaces and the surreals, the basic theory of h-levels, and a significant amount of category theory centered around comma categories and functoriality of various constructions involving comma categories.  A significant amount of work has gone into ensuring that the library compiles quickly.  This talk will discuss the various constructions in the HoTT library, as well as the design choices and features, both of Coq and of univalent type theory, which allow our library to compile and typecheck quickly.

  <li><h3>Exercising Nuprl's Open-Endedness</h3>
    <b>Vincent Rahli</b> (Cornell)
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
<strong>Abstract</strong>:

Nuprl is an interactive theorem prover that implements an
extensional constructive type theory.  Its types are interpreted as
partial equivalence relations (PERs) on closed terms.
Nuprl is both computationally and type-theoretically open-ended in the
sense that both its computation system and its type theory can be extended
as needed by checking a handful of conditions.  For example, Doug
Howe characterized the computations that can be added to
Nuprl in order to preserve its key properties such as the congruence of its
computational equivalence relation.  We have implemented Nuprl's
computation and type system in Coq, and we have showed
among other things that it is consistent by (1) proving the validity of its
inference rules w.r.t. its PER semantics, and (2) that False
is uninhabited.  Using our Coq framework
we can now easily add new computations and types to Nuprl by
mechanically verifying that all the necessary conditions still hold.
For example, we have recently added nominal features to Nuprl in order to
prove a version of Brouwer's continuity principle, as well as choice sequences
in order to prove truncated versions of the axiom of choice and
of Brouwer's bar induction principle.

<strong>Abstract</strong>:

    Lean is a new proof assistant which is designed to support Homotopy Type Theory. Lean has
a built-in HoTT library, which contains a solid foundation for doing HoTT, including most theorems
from the HoTT book. In addition, the library contains category theory and there is active
development in synthetic homotopy theory.

  <li><h3>Formalizing Double Groupoids and Cross Modules in the Lean
  Theorem Prover</h3>
    <b>Jacob von Raumer</b> (University of Nottingham/CMU)
    <p>
    <!-- <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br> -->
  <strong>Abstract</strong>:
  
  Lean is a new open source dependently typed theorem prover which is mainly being developed by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research. It is suited to be used for proof irrelevant reasoning as well as for proof relevant, univalent formalizations of mathematics. In my talk, I will present the experiences I had doing a formalization project in Lean.

One of the interesting aspects of homotopy type theory is the ability to perform synthetic homotopy theory on higher types. While for the first homotopy group the choice of a suitable algebraic structure to capture the homotopic information is obvious -- it's a group -- implementing a structure to capture the information about both the first and the second homotopy group (or groupoid) of a type and their interactions is more involved. Following Ronald Brown's book on Nonabelian Algebraic Topology, I formalized two structures: Double groupoids with thin structures and crossed modules on groupoids. I furthermore attempted to prove their equivalence. The project can be seen as a usability and performance test for the new theorem prover.
