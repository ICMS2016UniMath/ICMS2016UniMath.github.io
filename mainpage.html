<h3>Aim and Scope</h3>

The goal of the session is to bring together people in the proof assistant community working on the ideas inspired by the current activity surrounding the Univalence Axiom and, more generally, univalent foundations of mathematics and homotopy type theory. We expect to have representatives from several existent proof assistants as well as people working on the development of new type theories that will or may become the basis of proof assistants in the future. We consider the problem of developing the infrastructure that will allow formal specification and eventually verification of new proof assistants to be an important and possibly the most important one that is facing the community as the complexity of the type theories underlying the proof assistants grows and hope to also have talks from people and teams working in this direction.

  <li><h3>The HoTT/HoTT Library in Coq: Designing for Speed</h3>
    <b>Jason Gross</b> (MIT)
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
    <strong>Abstract</strong>: 

  The HoTT/HoTT library is one of the major Coq libraries exploring univalent foundations and homotopy type theory, the other being UniMath.  The library includes formalization of the basic type formers, some axiomatic higher inductive types including the circle, the interval, suspensions, and quotients, a formalization of modalities (reflective subtoposes) using modules as a way to quantify over all universe levels, formalizations of Cantor spaces and the surreals, the basic theory of h-levels, and a significant amount of category theory centered around comma categories and functoriality of various constructions involving comma categories.  A significant amount of work has gone into ensuring that the library compiles quickly.  This talk will discuss the various constructions in the HoTT library, as well as the design choices and features, both of Coq and of univalent type theory, which allow our library to compile and typecheck quickly.

  <li><h3>Exercising Nuprl's Open-Endedness</h3>
    <b>Vincent Rahli</b> (Cornell)
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
<strong>Abstract</strong>:

Nuprl is an interactive theorem prover that implements an
extensional constructive type theory.  Its types are interpreted as
partial equivalence relations (PERs) on closed terms.
Nuprl is both computationally and type-theoretically open-ended in the
sense that both its computation system and its type theory can be extended
as needed by checking a handful of conditions.  For example, Doug
Howe characterized the computations that can be added to
Nuprl in order to preserve its key properties such as the congruence of its
computational equivalence relation.  We have implemented Nuprl's
computation and type system in Coq, and we have showed
among other things that it is consistent by (1) proving the validity of its
inference rules w.r.t. its PER semantics, and (2) that False
is uninhabited.  Using our Coq framework
we can now easily add new computations and types to Nuprl by
mechanically verifying that all the necessary conditions still hold.
For example, we have recently added nominal features to Nuprl in order to
prove a version of Brouwer's continuity principle, as well as choice sequences
in order to prove truncated versions of the axiom of choice and
of Brouwer's bar induction principle.

    <b>Floris van Doorn</b> (CMU)

    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
<strong>Abstract</strong>:

    Lean is a new proof assistant which is designed to support Homotopy Type Theory. Lean has
a built-in HoTT library, which contains a solid foundation for doing HoTT, including most theorems
from the HoTT book. In addition, the library contains category theory and there is active
development in synthetic homotopy theory.

  <li><h3>Formalizing Double Groupoids and Cross Modules in the Lean
  Theorem Prover</h3>
    <b>Jacob von Raumer</b> (University of Nottingham/CMU)
    <p>
    <!-- <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br> -->
  <strong>Abstract</strong>:
  
  Lean is a new open source dependently typed theorem prover which is mainly being developed by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research. It is suited to be used for proof irrelevant reasoning as well as for proof relevant, univalent formalizations of mathematics. In my talk, I will present the experiences I had doing a formalization project in Lean.

One of the interesting aspects of homotopy type theory is the ability to perform synthetic homotopy theory on higher types. While for the first homotopy group the choice of a suitable algebraic structure to capture the homotopic information is obvious -- it's a group -- implementing a structure to capture the information about both the first and the second homotopy group (or groupoid) of a type and their interactions is more involved. Following Ronald Brown's book on Nonabelian Algebraic Topology, I formalized two structures: Double groupoids with thin structures and crossed modules on groupoids. I furthermore attempted to prove their equivalence. The project can be seen as a usability and performance test for the new theorem prover.
