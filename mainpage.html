<h3>Aim and Scope</h3>

The goal of the session is to bring together people in the proof assistant community working on the ideas inspired by the current activity surrounding the Univalence Axiom and, more generally, univalent foundations of mathematics and homotopy type theory. We expect to have representatives from several existent proof assistants as well as people working on the development of new type theories that will or may become the basis of proof assistants in the future. We consider the problem of developing the infrastructure that will allow formal specification and eventually verification of new proof assistants to be an important and possibly the most important one that is facing the community as the complexity of the type theories underlying the proof assistants grows and hope to also have talks from people and teams working in this direction.

  <li><h3>Exploiting uniformity in substitution: the Nuprl term model</h3>
    <b>Abishek Anand</b> (Cornell) 
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
  <strong>Abstract</strong>:
  Formalizing syntax and substitution is often the first step towards a formally verified proof assistant. Many non-trivial properties about substitution are typically required.
For a language with many term constructors, e.g. Nuprl, proofs about substitution typically need similar reasoning across many cases.
Therefore, while formalizing Nuprl, we used Howe's uniform representation of terms, which allowed us to consider only 3 cases while defining concepts like substitution and free variables, and proving properties about them. Extending the language with new constructs required absolutely no change in our thousands of lines of proofs about substitution, free variables, and alpha equality. 
Inspired by this robustness, we have created a library by generalizing our proofs to work for a  large class of languages. One can specify a language as a collection of term constructors and their variable-binding signatures, and use our rich collection of proofs. We have recently used this library for proofs about the Certicoq compiler for Coq.

  <li><h3>Inductive sets in UniMath</h3>
    <b>Benedikt Ahrens</b> (IAS/Coq-HoTT) with Ralph Matthes and
    Anders Mortberg
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
    <strong>Abstract</strong>: 
   UniMath, short for "Univalent Mathematics", refers to both a language
(a.k.a. a formal system) for mathematics, as well as to a
computer-checked library of mathematics formalized in that system.
The UniMath library, under active development, aims to coherently
integrate machine-checked proofs of mathematical results from many
different branches of mathematics.

The UniMath language is a dependent type theory, augmented by the
univalence axiom. One goal is to keep the language as small as possible,
to ease verification of the theory. In particular, general inductive
types are not part of the language.

In joint work with MÃ¶rtberg, we partially remedy this lack by
constructing a class of inductive (families of) sets. This involves a
formalization of a standard category-theoretic result on the
construction of initial algebras, as well as a mechanism to conveniently
use the inductive sets thus obtained.

By combining the present work with a previous formalization of
substitution systems by Ahrens and Matthes, we obtain a framework for
specifying, via a signature, programming languages with binders as
nested inductive datatypes. The datatypes are automatically equipped
with the structure of a monad, where the monadic operations and axioms
correspond to a well-behaved substitution operation.

  <li><h3>A Cubical Type Theory </h3>
    <b>Thorsten Altenkirch</b> (University of Nottingtham) with Ambrus Kaposi
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
    <strong>Abstract</strong>: 
    We develop a version of cubical Type Theory which is based on heterogenous logical relations with the view towards implementing Homotopy Type Theory. We compare our approach with the work by Coquand et al who have proposed a cubical type theory using the interval.
This is based on joint work with Ambrus Kaposi.

    <b>Marc Bezem</b> (University of Bergen)
    <p><!--

    <br>
    <br>-->
    <strong>Abstract</strong>: 
   What is a mathematical mistake? Which mistakes can be detected by
using proof assistants and which ones cannot?
We discuss various types of mistakes, in definitions, theorems,
proofs, as well as in axioms. We make an attempt at qualifying
how serious certain types of mistakes are and which role formalization
can play in detecting them.

    <br>-->
    <strong>Abstract</strong>:
We present a new experimental feature of Agda, developed by Jesper
Cockx, which allows the user to add custom rewrite rules to Agda. We
show how such rewrite rules can be used to implement higher inductive
types and can make univalence compute in some particular cases.

  <li><h3>A model of Cubical Type Theory in Nuprl</h3>
    <b>Mark Bickford</b> (Cornell University)
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
    <strong>Abstract</strong>: 
One type theory may serve as a meta theory for another and we
build a model of the target type theory in its meta theory.
This gives us a relative consistency theorem. Moreover, when we use
only constructive methods in the meta theory we obtain a constructive
interpretation of the target type theory.

We are carrying out such a project to get a constructive model
of the Cubical Type Theory of Coquand et.al. which satisfies the
Univalence Axiom. The model is a constructive presheaf model over
a base category in which the objects are finite sets of names, I, J,
and an arrow, I -> J is function from J to dM(I), the free DeMorgan algebra generated by I. 
To make this construction or, in general any presheaf model, it seems that we must reason extensionally as in set theory. This is difficult in an intensional type theory like Coq, but Nuprl's extensional constructive
type theory gives us the flexibility we need.

Since we have built a model of Nuprl in Coq, the constructive
interpretation of Cubical Type Theory with Univalence is therefore
built in two steps. First build Nuprl in Coq to get a good extensional
theory, and then use that theory to get a univalent theory.

Univalence follows from the existence of <i>uniform composition structure</i> for all types in the new theory, including a special Glue type. We have proved the equivalence of two different definitions of composition structure, and shown that they exist for
the Pi, Sigma, and Path types. By the time of this meeting, we expect that composition for Glue, composition for
Universe, and Univalence will all be verified.

  <li><h3>The HoTT/HoTT Library in Coq: Designing for Speed</h3>
    <b>Jason Gross</b> (MIT)
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
    <strong>Abstract</strong>: 

  The HoTT/HoTT library is one of the major Coq libraries exploring univalent foundations and homotopy type theory, the other being UniMath.  The library includes formalization of the basic type formers, some axiomatic higher inductive types including the circle, the interval, suspensions, and quotients, a formalization of modalities (reflective subtoposes) using modules as a way to quantify over all universe levels, formalizations of Cantor spaces and the surreals, the basic theory of h-levels, and a significant amount of category theory centered around comma categories and functoriality of various constructions involving comma categories.  A significant amount of work has gone into ensuring that the library compiles quickly.  This talk will discuss the various constructions in the HoTT library, as well as the design choices and features, both of Coq and of univalent type theory, which allow our library to compile and typecheck quickly.

  <li><h3>A construction of real numbers in UniMath</h3>
    <b>Catherine Lelay</b> (IAS)
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
    <strong>Abstract</strong>: 
The UniMath library is a Coq library which aims to formalize
    mathematics using the univalent point of view. For this purpose,
    it is important to include a formalization of real numbers. As
    non-negative real numbers are used in many applications such as
    metric and normed spaces, I decided to formalize them first and
    then use this definition to define all real numbers. Using the
    existing formalization of subtypes in UniMath, I was able to
    provide a definition of non-negative real numbers inspired by
    Dedekind cuts and to prove all of the expected properties of the
    resulting constructive field of real numbers.

  <li><h3>Cubical Type Theory</h3>
    <b>Anders Mortberg</b> (IAS) with C. Chen, T Coquand and S. Huber
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
    <strong>Abstract</strong>: 
    Cubical type theory is an extension of dependent type theory which
allows to directly reason about n-dimensional cubes (points, lines,
squares, cubes etc.). It is based on a model of type theory in cubical
sets given in a constructive metatheory. The type theory allows for
new ways to reason about identity types, e.g., function extensionality
as well as Voevodsky's univalence axiom are provable. We have
impemented an experimental proof assistant based on this type theory
called cubicaltt. In the talk I will discuss various examples that we
have formalized in cubicaltt which uses that univalence computes.

  <li><h3>Exercising Nuprl's Open-Endedness</h3>
    <b>Vincent Rahli</b> (Cornell)
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
<strong>Abstract</strong>:

Nuprl is an interactive theorem prover that implements an
extensional constructive type theory.  Its types are interpreted as
partial equivalence relations (PERs) on closed terms.
Nuprl is both computationally and type-theoretically open-ended in the
sense that both its computation system and its type theory can be extended
as needed by checking a handful of conditions.  For example, Doug
Howe characterized the computations that can be added to
Nuprl in order to preserve its key properties such as the congruence of its
computational equivalence relation.  We have implemented Nuprl's
computation and type system in Coq, and we have showed
among other things that it is consistent by (1) proving the validity of its
inference rules w.r.t. its PER semantics, and (2) that False
is uninhabited.  Using our Coq framework
we can now easily add new computations and types to Nuprl by
mechanically verifying that all the necessary conditions still hold.
For example, we have recently added nominal features to Nuprl in order to
prove a version of Brouwer's continuity principle, as well as choice sequences
in order to prove truncated versions of the axiom of choice and
of Brouwer's bar induction principle.

  <li><h3>Coq for Univalent Foundations</h3>
    <b>Matthieu Sozeau</b> (Inria Paris & IRIF, Universite Paris 7 Diderot)
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
    <strong>Abstract</strong>: 
    Coq is a general purpose proof assistant used for the formalization of
mathematics and computer science. It can be used to formalize large
results in the context of univalent foundations and homotopy type
theory, as witnessed by the UniMath and HoTT/HoTT libraries. However,
Coq is naturally geared towards working with an identity type living in
the propositional sort Prop, possibly enjoying uniqueness of identity
proofs. Moving towards a proof relevant identity type and universe
polymorphic constructions requires important changes in low-level
and high-level aspects of the system, from design choices 
for universe handling to tools for generalized rewriting and
dependent pattern-matching, whose meaning changes slightly.
I will describe the impact it had on these tools, the design choices
made and the applications of these tools in univalent formalizations.

  <li><h3>The Lean HoTT library</h3>
    <b>Floris van Doorn</b> (Department of Philosophy, CMU)
    <p><!--
    <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br>-->
<strong>Abstract</strong>:

    Lean is a new proof assistant which is designed to support Homotopy Type Theory. Lean has
a built-in HoTT library, which contains a solid foundation for doing HoTT, including most theorems
from the HoTT book. In addition, the library contains category theory and there is active
development in synthetic homotopy theory.

  <li><h3>Formalizing Double Groupoids and Cross Modules in the Lean
  Theorem Prover</h3>
    <b>Jacob von Raumer</b> (University of Nottingham)
    <p>
    <!-- <a href="??????">Extended abstract</a> 
    <br>
    <br> -->
  <strong>Abstract</strong>:
  
  Lean is a new open source dependently typed theorem prover which is mainly being developed by Leonardo de Moura at Microsoft Research. It is suited to be used for proof irrelevant reasoning as well as for proof relevant, univalent formalizations of mathematics. In my talk, I will present the experiences I had doing a formalization project in Lean.

One of the interesting aspects of homotopy type theory is the ability to perform synthetic homotopy theory on higher types. While for the first homotopy group the choice of a suitable algebraic structure to capture the homotopic information is obvious -- it's a group -- implementing a structure to capture the information about both the first and the second homotopy group (or groupoid) of a type and their interactions is more involved. Following Ronald Brown's book on Nonabelian Algebraic Topology, I formalized two structures: Double groupoids with thin structures and crossed modules on groupoids. I furthermore attempted to prove their equivalence. The project can be seen as a usability and performance test for the new theorem prover.
